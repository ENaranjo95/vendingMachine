# Full-Stack Vending Machine Application

This is a full-stack website that allow users to select an item from our vending machine and display in the DOM.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node-JS, MongoDB, Express and Passport

The objective of this project was to create a vending machine app that creates, reads, update, and delete (CRUD) items from the vending machine into our database and keeps record of items sold, profit per item, and total profit of total items sold to the admin page.
# Optimization

Still refactoring the app to include flexibility to add items to the vending machine and display in the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was the hardest project to work on. This include 3 collections for local user login, for items stored in the vending machine, and a collection of accumaltion of profits from all items sold from the vending machine. The challenges was simultaneously updating the database of items sold, collecting profits and displaying for the admin to see when he logins in.
